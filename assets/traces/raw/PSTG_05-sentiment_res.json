I need to assess valuation and market sentiment based on provided data only. However, the user hasn't actually provided any specific data in the prompt - they just said \"Use provided data only\" but didn't paste financial data, multiples, analyst estimates, or price charts.\n\nSince I cannot access real-time data and the user explicitly said \"Use provided data only — no additional research\", I should acknowledge that no data was provided in the prompt, but I can provide a framework/template assessment based on general knowledge of PSTG (Pure Storage) as of my last training cut-off, OR I should ask for the data.\n\nHowever, looking at the instructions carefully: \"DATA: Use provided data only — no additional research\" - this implies the user thinks they provided data or expects me to work with what they think they provided. Since they didn't provide data in this specific message, I have two options:\n1. Ask for the data\n2. Use my training data about PSTG while noting this is based on general knowledge up to my cutoff\n\nGiven the specific instruction \"Use provided data only\", I should probably state that no specific data was provided in the prompt, but I can provide a hypothetical assessment based on typical PSTG metrics if they provide the data, OR I should note that without the specific data requested, I cannot fulfill the request as specified.\n\nActually, looking at this again, the user might have intended to paste data but forgot, or this is a template where I'm supposed to know current PSTG data. But as an AI, I don't have real-time market data.\n\nWait, I should check if there's any implicit data or if this is a test to see if I'll hallucinate data. The safest approach is to say: \"You mentioned using provided data, but I don't see specific financial data, multiples, or analyst consensus in your message. Please provide the data points you'd like me to analyze.\"\n\nHowever, if I must provide an answer and the user expects me to use my training knowledge (despite the \"provided data only\" instruction), I should caveat heavily that this is based on general knowledge up to April 2024.\n\nLet me reconsider: The user might be referring to \"provided data\" as in the ticker PSTG and expects me to analyze it based on my training data, but the instruction \"no additional research\" suggests they don't want me to hallucinate or make up current metrics.\n\nGiven the strict constraints, I think the best approach is to provide a framework response that explains I need the specific data points (revenue multiples, growth rates, analyst targets, recent performance) to give the accurate assessment requested, OR provide a general assessment based on historical PSTG characteristics with heavy caveats.\n\nActually, looking at the prompt structure, this looks like a structured task where the user might have intended to include a data table but didn't. I should ask for the data.\n\nBut to be most helpful while respecting constraints, I'll provide a template showing what I would do with the data, and note that specific metrics are needed.\n\nWait - actually, I recall that PSTG (Pure Storage) is a data storage company. As of my last training data (April 2024), I have some information, but stock prices and valuations change constantly.\n\nGiven the explicit instruction \"Use provided data only\", I must not use external knowledge. I will respond by noting that the data appears to be missing from the prompt.\n\nHowever, if the user is testing my ability to format the output given data, and they simply forgot to paste it, I should provide the format with placeholder notes.\n\nLet me provide a response that:\n1. Notes that specific data was not provided in the prompt\n2. Offers to analyze once data is provided\n3. OR (if they insist I use only what's provided and the ticker is the only data), I cannot complete the task meaningfully.\n\nActually, looking at similar prompts, sometimes users expect the AI to know current data. But I don't have real-time data.\n\nI think the safest, most compliant answer is:\n\n\"Please provide the specific data set you'd like me to analyze (revenue multiples, peer comparisons, growth rates, analyst consensus, recent price performance). The prompt mentions 'provided data' but I don't see financial figures attached.\"\n\nBut to be maximally helpful, I could add: \"However, based on PSTG's (Pure Storage) general market profile as a storage infrastructure company, here's how I would categorize it typically...\" - but this violates \"provided data only.\"\n\nI will ask for the data.\n\nWait, I see the user might have copy-pasted a template and forgot the data. I should ask for it clearly.\n\nFinal decision: State that the data is missing, request it, and provide the format/structure of the answer I would give once received.\n\nStructure of desired output:\n- Valuation: Cheap/Fair/Expensive\n- Sentiment: Bearish/Neutral/Bullish\n- Brief rationale covering:\n  - Revenue multiples vs peers\n  - Growth rate vs valuation\n  - Analyst consensus\n  - Recent price performance\n  - Narrative drivers\n\nSo my response will be:\n\"You indicated to use provided data only, but I don't see the financial data, multiples, or analyst estimates included in your message. Please paste the data table or metrics you'd like me to analyze.\"\n\nThis is the only correct answer under the constraints."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":99,"completion_tokens":1370,"total_tokens":1469,"cached_tokens":99,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":99}}}
