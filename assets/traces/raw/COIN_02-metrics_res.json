I need to score key financial metrics using a 🔴🟡🟢 (red/yellow/green) framework.\n\n However, the user says \"DATA: Use provided data only — no additional research\" but hasn't actually provided any data in the prompt. This is a problem. \n\n Wait, looking carefully at the prompt: \"DATA: Use provided data only — no additional research\" - but there is no data provided in the prompt. This seems like the user might have forgotten to paste the data, or expects me to acknowledge that data is missing.\n\n However, given that this is likely a test or template scenario, and the company is COIN (Coinbase), I should probably note that data is missing, OR if this is a roleplay where I'm expected to know recent COIN metrics, I should use recent public data but note that I'm doing so.\n\n Actually, looking at the constraints: \"Use provided data only — no additional research\" clearly indicates I should not look up current data. Since no data was provided, I must state that I cannot complete the task without the data, or ask for the data.\n\n But wait - perhaps the user made a formatting error and expects me to simulate this with hypothetical data? Or perhaps \"COIN\" is a generic placeholder?\n\n Given the strict instruction \"Use provided data only\", the most accurate response is to indicate that no data was provided in the prompt, therefore I cannot complete the scoring.\n\n However, looking at typical patterns in these types of prompts, sometimes users paste data in a previous message or expect the AI to work with recent knowledge despite the constraint. But the constraint is explicit: \"no additional research.\"\n\n I should respond by noting that the data appears to be missing from the prompt, and ask the user to provide the specific financial figures for COIN so I can apply the scoring framework.\n\n Wait, I should reconsider. Is it possible that \"COIN\" refers to something else? Or is this a test where I should create a template response showing how I would score if I had data?\n\n Actually, the safest approach is to state that the data is missing, but provide a template/example of how I would structure the response if data were provided, or ask for the data.\n\n But looking at the user's request again, they might have intended to paste financial data but forgot. The professional response is to point this out politely.\n\n Structure:\n 1. Note that data appears to be missing from the prompt\n 2. Provide a template/table showing the framework with placeholders or hypothetical example data clearly marked as illustrative\n 3. OR simply ask for the data\n\n Given the specific instruction \"Use provided data only\", I cannot invent data for Coinbase (COIN) as that would violate the instruction. I must ask for the data.\n\n Let me draft the response:\n\n \"I notice that no financial data was provided in your prompt for COIN (Coinbase). To complete the 🔴🟡🟢 scoring framework using 'provided data only,' please provide the following metrics:\n\n - Revenue growth (%)\n - Gross margin (%)\n - Operating margin (%)\n - FCF margin (%)\n - Dollar net retention (%)\n - Cash position ($B or relevant figure)\n\n Once you provide these figures, I will score them accordingly.\"\n\n But perhaps the user expects me to treat this as a hypothetical exercise? No, that's risky with the \"no additional research\" constraint.\n\n Alternative: Maybe the user is referring to a specific dataset from a previous context that I don't have access to in this conversation thread? As an AI, I don't have memory of previous conversations unless they're in the current context. The prompt appears to be standalone.\n\n I will politely indicate that the data is missing and request it, while showing the format I would use once received.\n\n Actually, looking at the prompt structure again, maybe I should provide a demonstration with placeholder text like \"[Insert Data]\" to show the format?\n\n No, that wouldn't be helpful. The best approach is to clearly state that I need the data to comply with the \"provided data only\" rule.\n\n Wait - one more thought: Is it possible \"COIN\" is not Coinbase but a different company, or a case study company with data implied? Without data, I cannot know.\n\n Final decision: I will inform the user that the financial data for COIN was not included in the prompt and ask them to provide it so I can complete the analysis as requested.\n\n However, to be maximally helpful, I can provide an example of what the output would look like using hypothetical placeholder values, clearly labeled as \"Example Format Only - Awaiting Your Data.\"\n\n Let me do both: state the missing data issue, then provide a template with clear placeholders.\n\n Actually, looking at the strictness of the prompt, I should just ask for the data. But given that users often appreciate seeing the expected format, I'll provide a template marked as illustrative.\n\n Structure of response:\n 1. Acknowledgment that data is missing\n 2. Request for specific data points\n 3. Template table showing the structure (with placeholder text like \"DATA NEEDED\")\n 4. Template insight section\n\n Or, I could make reasonable assumptions based on Coinbase's recent public earnings (Q3 2024 or latest), but that violates \"no additional research\" and \"provided data only.\"\n\n I will not violate the constraint. I will ask for the data.\n\n Response content:\n \"I’m ready to score COIN’s metrics using the 🔴🟡🟢 framework, but I don’t see the financial data provided in your prompt. To complete this task using provided data only (per your instructions), please share the specific figures for:\n\n - Revenue growth (YoY %)\n - Gross margin (%)\n - Operating margin (%)\n - FCF margin (%)\n - Dollar net retention (%)\n - Cash position ($ amount)\n\n Once provided, I’ll deliver the scored metrics table and health insights.\"\n\n This is honest and compliant."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":98,"completion_tokens":1363,"total_tokens":1461,"cached_tokens":98,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":98}}}
