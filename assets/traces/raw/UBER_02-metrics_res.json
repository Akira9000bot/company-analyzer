However, the user mentioned \"Use provided data only — no additional research\" but didn't actually provide any data in the prompt.\n\nThis is a constraint conflict: I need to use provided data, but no data was provided. I have a few options:\n1. Ask for the data (but the user wants strict output constraints)\n2. Use my training data knowledge of Uber's recent financials (but this violates \"use provided data only\")\n3. Create a template/example showing how it would look if data were provided\n4. State that data is missing\n\nGiven the strict output constraints (table format only, max 500 tokens, no prose explanations beyond table and 1 summary sentence), asking for clarification would violate the constraints. Using external knowledge violates the \"provided data only\" rule.\n\nThe most appropriate approach is to indicate that data is required but do so within the strict formatting constraints, or create a placeholder table indicating missing data. However, looking at the strict constraints again: \"Use table format only. Max 500 tokens. No prose explanations beyond table and 1 summary sentence.\"\n\nActually, re-reading carefully: The user says \"Use provided data only\" but didn't provide data. This is likely an error in the prompt. Given the strict constraints on output format, I should probably assume this is a template task and either:\na) State that data is missing in the required format\nb) Use placeholder/example data clearly marked as such\n\nBut the safest approach given \"no additional research\" and \"use provided data only\" is to output a table indicating that data was not provided, or request the data in the single allowed summary sentence.\n\nWait, looking at the instruction again: \"DATA: Use provided data only — no additional research\". This is a strict constraint. If I make up numbers or use my training data, I violate this. If I don't provide the table, I violate the output format constraint.\n\nBest compromise: Create the table structure with \"N/A\" or \"Data not provided\" entries and use the summary sentence to note that financial data is required to complete the scoring.\n\nActually, I can check if there's any implicit context... No, this appears to be a standalone request.\n\nLet me structure:\n- Table with the 6 metrics listed\n- Color score column: \"⚪\" or \"N/A\" (since no data)\n- Justification: \"Data not provided\"\n- Summary sentence: Note that data is missing\n\nBut that feels unhelpful. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to know that as an AI, I don't have real-time data unless provided, so I should indicate the constraint violation clearly but concisely.\n\nGiven the strict token limit (500 tokens max) and format requirements, I'll create the table with placeholders indicating missing data.\n\nWait, I should reconsider. Maybe the user copy-pasted this from a template where data was supposed to be included but got lost. In many AI prompts, users say \"use provided data\" referring to data in an earlier message or attachment that didn't come through.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will:\n1. Create the required table format\n2. Put \"N/A - No data provided\" in the score/justification columns\n3. Use the summary sentence to state that financial data is required for scoring\n\nThis adheres to all constraints:\n- Table format only (plus 1 sentence)\n- No additional research (I didn't research Uber's actual metrics)\n- Max 500 tokens\n- No prose beyond table and 1 sentence\n\nLet me draft:\n\n| Metric | Score | Justification |\n|--------|-------|---------------|\n| Revenue growth | ⚪ | Data not provided |\n| Gross margin | ⚪ | Data not provided |\n| Operating margin | ⚪ | Data not provided |\n| FCF margin | ⚪ | Data not provided |\n| Dollar net retention | ⚪ | Data not provided |\n| Cash position | ⚪ | Data not provided |\n\nSummary: Financial data was not provided in the prompt; please provide Uber's specific metric values to enable 🔴🟡🟢 scoring.\n\nThat's compliant. But wait, the user might have intended to include data and forgot. Using ⚪ (white circle) or simply stating \"No data\" is safest.\n\nActually, looking at the emoji constraint: 🔴🟡🟢 framework. I should probably not introduce new colors like ⚪. I should just state \"N/A\".\n\nRevised:\n\n| Metric | Score | Justification |\n|--------|-------|---------------|\n| Revenue growth | N/A | No data provided |\n| Gross margin | N/A | No data provided |\n| Operating margin | N/A | No data provided |\n| FCF margin | N/A | No data provided |\n| Dollar net retention | N/A | No data provided |\n| Cash position | N/A | No data provided |\n\nSummary: Input data is required to score Uber's metrics using the 🔴🟡🟢 framework; please provide the specific financial values.\n\nThis is safe and compliant."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":126,"completion_tokens":1179,"total_tokens":1305,"cached_tokens":126,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":126}}}
