However, the user mentioned \"Use provided data only — no additional research\" but didn't actually provide any data in the prompt.\n\nThis is a constraint conflict. I need to:\n1. Acknowledge that no data was provided in the prompt\n2. Either ask for the data OR proceed with the most recent publicly available data while noting this limitation\n3. Since the user explicitly said \"no additional research,\" I should not make up data or use my training data to fill in specific numbers without disclaimer\n\nHowever, looking at the context, this appears to be a template or instruction-following exercise where the user expects me to work with hypothetical or implied data, OR they forgot to paste the data. But given the strict instruction \"Use provided data only,\" I cannot invent Apple's current financial metrics.\n\nWait, I should check if there's any implicit context. The user might be testing my ability to follow instructions strictly. If I don't have the data, I cannot complete the task accurately.\n\nBest approach:\n- State that the data appears to be missing from the prompt\n- Offer to complete the analysis if they provide the data, OR\n- If they want me to use my knowledge cutoff data, I should ask for confirmation since they said \"no additional research\"\n\nActually, looking at typical usage patterns, sometimes users paste data in a previous message or expect me to know current data. But the \"no additional research\" constraint is strict.\n\nI think the most helpful response is to point out the missing data and provide a template/example of how I would score it if data were provided, or ask them to provide the specific numbers.\n\nBut wait - maybe I should assume they want me to treat this as a hypothetical exercise? No, that would violate \"use provided data only.\"\n\nDecision: I will politely note that the financial data for AAPL was not included in the prompt, and request the specific metric values so I can apply the scoring framework as requested.\n\nHowever, if I must provide something useful, I could provide the framework methodology and show what ranges typically constitute 🔴🟡🟢 for each metric in the tech/hardware sector, then invite them to fill in the numbers.\n\nActually, reconsidering: The user might have intended to paste data but forgot. I should ask for it.\n\nStructure:\n1. Note that data is missing\n2. Provide the template/format I would use once data is provided\n3. OR (if I want to be maximally helpful while respecting constraints) provide general industry benchmarks for context without claiming they are AAPL's specific numbers\n\nBut the safest path is to ask for the data.\n\nWait, I recall that sometimes in these prompts, the \"data\" is supposed to be in the conversation history or the user made an error. Since I don't see previous context, I'll proceed with asking for the data.\n\nHowever, looking at the pattern of these requests, sometimes users expect me to use my training data up to my knowledge cutoff. But \"no additional research\" usually means \"don't go look up current stock prices.\"\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll provide a response that:\n1. Acknowledges no specific dataset was provided\n2. Offers to complete the analysis with the requested format once data is provided\n3. Provides a hypothetical example using AAPL's recent historical trends (pre-2024 cutoff) with clear disclaimers that these are approximations from training data, not the \"provided data\" requested\n\nActually, that's risky. The user said \"Use provided data only.\" If I make up numbers, I'm violating that.\n\nFinal decision: I will state that the data appears to be missing and provide the structured template showing how I would score the metrics once the data is provided.\n\nTemplate format:\n| Metric | Value | Score | Justification |\n| Revenue growth | [X%] | 🔴/🟡/🟢 | [Reason] |\n...\n\nThen provide the 1-2 sentence insight section placeholder.\n\nThis respects the constraint while being maximally helpful.\n\nWait, I should check if the user provided data in an attachment or something I can't see? No, this is text-only.\n\nOkay, I'll proceed with requesting the missing data but showing the exact format I will use.\n\nActually, looking at the prompt again, maybe they want me to evaluate AAPL based on general knowledge but score it relatively? No, \"use provided data only\" is explicit.\n\nI'll write:\n\n\"I don't see the specific financial data for AAPL included in your message. To complete the 🔴🟡🟢 scoring using only provided data as requested, please share the current values for:\n- Revenue growth (YoY %)\n- Gross margin (%)\n- Operating margin (%)\n- FCF margin (%)\n- Dollar net retention (%)\n- Cash position ($B or relative to debt)\n\nOnce provided, I'll format the analysis as requested.\"\n\nThen I'll add an example of how it would look with placeholder text, clearly labeled as illustrative.\n\nThis seems like the correct approach."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":98,"completion_tokens":1405,"total_tokens":1503}}
