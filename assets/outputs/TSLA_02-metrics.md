| Metric | Score | Value | Justification |
|--------|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Revenue growth** | 🟢 | +19% YoY | Robust double-digit expansion at $97.7B scale demonstrates sustained demand elasticity despite pricing pressure |
| **Gross margin** | 🟡 | 17.9% | Healthy relative to legacy auto (10-15%) but compressed from Tesla's historical 20%+ peaks due to strategic price cuts |
| **Operating margin** | 🟡 | 8.2% | Solid absolute profitability vs. industry peers, though declining trajectory reflects margin sacrifice to defend volume |
| **FCF margin** | 🟡 | 5.4% | Positive free cash flow supports capital-intensive AI/robotics bets, but thin margin leaves limited buffer for execution errors |
| **Dollar net retention** | ⚪ | N/A | Not disclosed; hardware-centric business model lacks standard SaaS retention metrics |
| **Cash position** | 🟢 | $29B ($20B net) | Fortress balance sheet with $20B net cash provides ample runway for Optimus/Robotaxi R&D and gigafactory expansion |

**Overall Health**: Tesla exhibits a bifurcated financial profile—strong growth momentum and liquidity position the company to capture AI/robotics opportunities, but margin compression across all profitability layers signals a strategic trade-off of near-term earnings for market share that requires flawless volume execution to justify valuation.
