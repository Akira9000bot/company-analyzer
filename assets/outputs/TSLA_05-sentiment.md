**Valuation: EXPENSIVE**

Tesla trades at ~8.2x sales ($800B market cap / $97.7B revenue), a massive premium to traditional auto manufacturers (0.3-0.8x). At implied P/E of ~65-70x (depending on exact share count), the stock prices in flawless execution of AI/robotics ventures (Optimus, Robotaxi, FSD licensing) rather than current auto fundamentals. While 19% revenue growth justifies some premium, the margin compression (17.9% gross, 8.2% operating) from aggressive price cuts limits earnings leverage.

**Sentiment: NEUTRAL-BULLISH**

**Bullish drivers:** AI/robotics narrative (Optimus deployment, FSD licensing potential), record delivery volumes (1.8M), strong balance sheet ($29B cash vs $9B debt), and energy storage expansion.

**Bearish constraints:** Operating margin pressure from price wars, declining regulatory credits as revenue percentage, and the gap between robotaxi promises and regulatory reality. Market appears priced for "show me" mode on AI monetization despite excitement.

**Verdict:** Valuation assumes Tesla successfully pivots from automaker to AI/robotics platform; any execution delays on FSD/Optimus pose significant downside risk at current multiples.
