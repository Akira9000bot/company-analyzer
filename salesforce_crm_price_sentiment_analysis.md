**Using price data from February 2025 – February 2026 and news from the same period**

---

## 🧠 1) Overall Takeaway

**Why It Moved:** Salesforce has experienced significant price volatility over the past 12 months, declining approximately **43% from its 52-week high of $324.45** to current levels near $185. The primary drivers include AI disruption concerns affecting the software sector, activist investor Starboard Value reducing its stake, and recent workforce reductions of under 1,000 roles. Despite these headwinds, the company continues investing heavily in its Agentforce AI platform.

**Next Catalyst:** Q4 FY2026 Earnings Report on **February 25, 2026** – Wall Street will focus on Agentforce adoption metrics, guidance updates, and margin expansion progress.

**Outlook (12M): 🟡 Neutral** — While Salesforce maintains strong fundamentals and AI positioning through Agentforce, near-term headwinds from AI disruption fears and macro uncertainty warrant caution. The stock appears undervalued relative to analyst targets but faces execution risks.
