🔄 Business Dynamics

🛒 How often do customers buy?
Cloudflare operates on a **subscription/SaaS model** with primarily recurring revenue:
• Monthly and annual subscription plans
• Usage-based pricing for certain services (Workers requests, bandwidth)
• Land-and-expand model: customers start small and grow over time
• Dollar-based net retention rate historically above 115%, indicating strong upsell/cross-sell
• Recent RPO (remaining performance obligation) growth of 48% YoY shows strong future revenue visibility

📈 Can they raise prices?
Cloudflare demonstrates **strong pricing power** supported by:
• **Gross margins of 74-77%** consistently maintained, indicating value capture
• Mission-critical services (security, performance) with high switching costs
• Network effects: more customers = better threat intelligence = stronger product
• Recently closed largest-ever deal at $42.5M/year, demonstrating enterprise willingness to pay premium prices
• "Freemium to premium" funnel creates pricing tier flexibility
• AI-driven demand creating new monetization opportunities (Workers AI, AI Gateway)

However, they compete with hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP) on some services, creating pricing pressure in certain segments.

📉 What happens in recession?
Cloudflare shows **resilient characteristics** but is not fully recession-tested as a public company:
• **Critical infrastructure**: Security and uptime are non-discretionary for most businesses
• Counter-cyclical benefit: economic stress often increases cyberattack frequency
• Cost-saving value prop: helps customers reduce IT complexity and infrastructure costs
• Strong balance sheet: $4.1B cash/cash equivalents (Feb 2026) provides runway
• Still unprofitable on GAAP basis (net loss of $102M in FY2025), though improving toward profitability
• Free cash flow positive: $260.6M in FY2025 (12% margin)
• Revenue growth remained strong through 2022-2023 macro headwinds (32-48% growth)

Risk factors include potential enterprise budget cuts for non-core services and increased churn among SMB customers during prolonged downturns.
